# Abstract

Fracture risk assessments are essential to evaluate and prevent osteoporotic fractures. While it is desirable to collect all relevant data about patients regarding their susceptibility to fractures to make an accurate assessment, in real-world environments osteoporosis patient data can be incorrect, inconsistent, or missing.


A crucial component to calculating the fracture risk is theBone Mineral Density(BMD) T-score (used in fracture risk calculators: e.g., FRAX, CAROC). BMD tests are conducted at hospitals or diagnostic imagingclinics at the request of a physician. However, many people donâ€™t get tested.
